# Google/YouTube API with Python

This project serves as an educational resource for developers interested in learning how to interact with the YouTube Data API. Through Python-based examples, it provides insights into handling both public data and performing authorized actions on your own account, such as editing video metadata.

## Project Overview

The repository is structured to showcase examples of Google/YouTube API interactions. The project emphasizes clean, reusable code and practical workflows for integrating Google APIs into your applications.

## Google API Authorization Credentials

To access the YouTube Data API, you need to configure appropriate credentials. The type of credentials depends on your use case:

### OAuth 2.0

Use OAuth 2.0 credentials when your application needs access to private user data. Your application sends a client ID and potentially a client secret to obtain an OAuth token. These credentials support scenarios like editing your YouTube video titles or descriptions.

- **How to Set Up**: Visit the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), create a project, and configure an OAuth consent screen along with credentials.

### API Keys

Use API keys for accessing public data without the need for user authentication. API keys are project-specific and can be generated in the Google Cloud Console.

## Identifying a YouTube Channel ID

To work with specific channels, you need the channel’s unique ID. You can find this by navigating to the desired YouTube channel and inspecting its URL, which will look like:

```
https://www.youtube.com/channel/<CHANNEL_ID>
```
